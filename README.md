    cd bright-reality
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your specific configuration:
    ```env
    VITE_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=your_google_script_url_here
    ```

## 🏗️ Build for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder, ready to be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service.

## 🌐 Deployment

This project handles client-side routing. When deploying to static hosts (like Vercel/Netlify), ensure you have a rewrite rule pointing all traffic to `index.html`.

For generic servers, you may need to configure your web server (Nginx/Apache) to redirect 404s to `index.html`.
